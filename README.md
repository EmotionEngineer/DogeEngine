# DogeEngine
Unity demonstration of a framework for modeling dog behavior.
Warning: Unity works horribly with dynamic AVX-based libraries, prepare for constant crashes.
TODO:
Porting to Unreal Engine
Improving the accuracy, using LSTM instead of DNN
Change animations to object physics
Support for using objects (sticks, balls)
etc...
