# DogeEngine
## Unity demonstration of a framework for modeling dog behavior
__Warning: Unity works horribly with dynamic AVX-based libraries, prepare for constant crashes__
### TODO
__- Porting to Unreal Engine__  
__- Improving the accuracy, using LSTM instead of DNN__  
__- Change animations to object physics__  
__- Support for using objects (sticks, balls)__
